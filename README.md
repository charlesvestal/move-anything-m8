# M8 LPP Emulator for Move Everything

Novation Launchpad Pro emulation for Dirtywave M8, allowing you to use Ableton Move as an M8 controller.

## Prerequisites

- [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-anything) installed on your Ableton Move
- Dirtywave M8 hardware

## Features

- Emulates Launchpad Pro MIDI protocol
- Full pad matrix with velocity sensitivity
- Compatible with M8's Launchpad Pro mode

## Building

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

## Installation

Via Module Store (recommended):
- Launch Move Everything → Module Store → Utilities → M8 LPP Emulator

Manual installation:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Usage

1. Connect M8 to Move via USB-A port
2. Launch M8 LPP Emulator module
3. Configure M8 to use Launchpad Pro mode

## Important: MIDI Channel Configuration

The M8 LPP Emulator communicates on **MIDI channel 1**. To avoid conflicts:

- Set Move tracks to use **channel 2 or higher**
- Set shadow mode slots to use **channel 2 or higher** (via receive/forward channel settings)
- Do not configure Move tracks to listen on channel 1 and output to channel 1, as this creates MIDI echo that interferes with M8 communication

This ensures M8's Launchpad Pro protocol doesn't trigger Move's synths or get echoed back.
